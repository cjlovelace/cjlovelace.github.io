<h1>SURE 2022 - User Accessibility in Virtual Reality</h1>
  <p>Happy to see you here! This SURE Research project conducted by Cody Lovelace under the guidance of Dr. Bruce Maxim at the University of Michigan-Dearborn aims to explore the user experience of disabled users of virtual reality. As a new chapter of the digital frontier, academic research surrounding virtual reality is currently limited in scope and depth.</p>
