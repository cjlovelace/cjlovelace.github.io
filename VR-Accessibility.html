      <h2>Introduction to Our Research</h2>
    <p>This SURE Research project conducted by Cody Lovelace under the guidance of Dr. Bruce Maxim at the University of Michigan-Dearborn aims to explore the user experience of disabled users of virtual reality. As a new chapter of the digital frontier, academic research surrounding virtual reality is currently limited in scope and depth.</p>
    
    <p>By analyzing current scholarly articles in this field, categorizing into common themes, and using this knowledge to implement accessibility tools into an <a href="http://gamelab.cis.umd.umich.edu/elb/">existing Unity project</a>, we hope to contribute academic research that helps shape the understanding and future progress to improve the experiences of all users of virtual reality.</p>
